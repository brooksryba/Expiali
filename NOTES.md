New User Flow:
    - Download app
    - Open for first time
    - Home page launches with welcome
    - Prompt user to setup profile
    - Return to home page
    - Show explanation widgets on each interface
    - Guide user to join one local community

User Considerations: 
    - Login once, forget after
    - Facilitate passwordless accounts through email
    - Allow user to disable explanation prompts
    - Reduce burden of user to break-ice and socialize
